        <h2>Little Lemonâ€™s Story</h2>
        <p>
          Our restaurant began with a simple idea: bring authentic Mediterranean
          flavors to the heart of Chicago. Founded by the Rossi family in 1995,
          we blend time-honoured recipes with modern culinary techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
          Great food brings people together. Every dish is prepared with the
          finest locally-sourced ingredients and a dash of Mediterranean
          hospitality.
